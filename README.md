Wineskin is a tool used to make ports of Windows software to Mac OS X. 

## About
The ports are in the form of normal Mac application bundle wrappers.  It works like a wrapper around the Windows software, and you can share just the wrappers if you choose. Make ports/wrappers to share with others, make ports of your own open source, free, or commercial software, or just make a port for yourself!  Why install and use Windows if you donâ€™t need to?

## Modifications
As you may have already noticed, this is not the [original Wineskin repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/wineskin/code/ci/master/tree/). That repository counts with some changes to make Wineskin more stable, and to make its source easier to maintain. Considering this, lots of changes were made in WineskinApp and WineskinLauncher, and now both or them use ObjectiveC_Extension and some new classes to perform some of their tasks. 

## List of modifications
